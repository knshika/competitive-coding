recursion 
1. decisions make input smaller
2. recursion is used when we have some choice and we make decisions
3. recursive tree using input -output method
4. make decision tree and write code using that
 

 methods to solve problem 
 1. recursive tree (ex- print subset)(medium) input-output method
 when you have to make choice , decision => generally give solution in leaf node
 2. Hypothesis-Induction-Base Condition (IBH) (easy)
 Hypothesis - realize the problem , if( p(n) gives 1 to n , then p(n-1) gives 1 to n-1)
 Induction - formailze the code (ex- print 1 to n) p(n-1)+cout<<n
 Base - smallest valid input (ex- p(1)=1 in above case)
 void print(n){
     if(n==1) cout<<n<<" ";
     print(n-1);
     cout<<n<<" ";
 }
 in thiis case resursive tree will be like print(7)->print(6)->.....print(1)

 print n to 1
 p(n) n to 1
 p(n-1) n-1 to 1

 => p(7) => 7 to 1 
   p(6)=> 7 + 6 to 1

    void print(n){
     if(n==1) cout<<n<<" ";
     cout<<n<<" ";
     print(n-1);
 }

 q3 factorial
 int factorial(n){
 if (n==1) return fac;
 return n*factorial(n-1)
 }
